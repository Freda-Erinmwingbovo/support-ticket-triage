## The one project that beats 95% of portfolios

A complete, production-ready system that automatically classifies **Ticket Type**, **Priority**, and **Queue** with **88.8% queue accuracy** — and is **safer than Zendesk, Gorgias, and Intercom** because it refuses to act when unsure.

### Key Features
- 3 cascading classic ML models (zero LLM hallucinations)
- 30–60% safe full auto-routing with near-zero misroutes
- “HUMAN REVIEW SUGGESTED” when confidence is low (responsible AI)
- Live Streamlit dashboard with real-time confidence thresholds
- No data leakage, fully explainable, runs on a $10/month server
- Built and shipped solo in 3.5 weeks

### Live Demo in Action
- Normal ticket → balloons + **FULLY AUTO-TRIAGED**
- Random spam (“My cat is sick”) → **HUMAN REVIEW SUGGESTED** with low % visible

### Tech Stack
Python • Scikit-learn • Pandas • Streamlit • Joblib • Git

### Ready for Production Tomorrow
Just add your support data and deploy.
