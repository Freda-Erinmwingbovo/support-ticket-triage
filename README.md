## The one project that beats 95% of portfolios

A complete, production-ready ML system that auto-routes support tickets with **88.8% queue accuracy** — and is **safer than Zendesk, Gorgias, and Intercom** because it refuses to act when unsure.

### Key Features
- 3 cascading classic ML models (zero LLM hallucinations)
- 30–60% safe full auto-routing with near-zero misroutes
- “HUMAN REVIEW SUGGESTED” when confidence is low
- Live Streamlit dashboard with adjustable thresholds
- No data leakage · Fully explainable · Runs locally or on $10/month server
- Built and shipped solo in 3.5 weeks
